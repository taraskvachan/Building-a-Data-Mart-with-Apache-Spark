# Building a Data Mart with Apache Spark (Webinar)

## Project Description

In this project, we worked with data obtained from a website that sold kitchen design projects. The main goal was to consolidate the data into a single data warehouse and analyze the quality of advertising interactions.

Data Sources:
<ol>
<li>Visits — data from ClickHouse</li>
<li>Advertising expenditures — data from Postgres</li>
<li>Data mapping dictionary — CSV file</li>
<li>Completed forms on the website and ordered projects — data from HDFS (Parquet)</li>
</ol>

## Project Phases

<ol>
<li>Data transformation: Based on the technical specification Methodology, the data was transformed.</li>
<li>Building the data warehouse: The data warehouse was constructed using the One Big Table (OBT) concept.</li>
<li>Data visualization: After building the data warehouse, we connected to the Metabase data visualization tool and created a dashboard to present the results.</li>
</ol>
